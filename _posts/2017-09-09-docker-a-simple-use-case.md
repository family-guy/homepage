In a previous post, we showed how to setup an Apache web server on an Amazon EC2 instance. 

This was fairly quick and straightforward. However, when deploying an actual web application, it is likely to take a lot longer as your application will have dependencies and require other software to be installed, run-time environment variables need to be set, the web server needs to be configured, etc. 

Further, what happens if one day you want to deploy your app on a different server? Will it work out-of-the-box? Do you remember all the steps to do the configuration, setup, etc.? Do you have the necessary tests ready to check the deployment went successfully? Even if all this is documented, you will have to follow each step carefully. **Upshot - all this can be time-consuming and stressful.**

Enter [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to the rescue. Your whole app and everything required to run it is packaged neatly into a self-contained unit, a Docker *container* which is simply a Unix process. All you need to do is start it.

In this post, we are going to setup the simplest possible web application on a new server using Docker. All the app does is serve up a single static HTML file, i.e. the app consists of just a homepage.

**Step 1**

Login to your new server. As the server is new, there is no web server software (Apache, Nginx, etc.) installed thus navigating to `http://myipaddress` returns an `unable to connect error` in the browser (even after opening up port 80).

**Step 2**

Install Docker. The exact command(s) will depend on your server's OS, but on Amazon Linux AMI

{% highlight bash %}
sudo yum install -y docker
{% endhighlight %}

suffices.

**Step 3**

Start the Docker service

{% highlight bash %}
sudo service docker start
{% endhighlight %}

**Step 4**

We are going to use Apache to serve up our homepage. Usually, we look for `/var/www/html` and place our HTML files there. However, as Apache isn't installed, `/var/www` does not exist.

Instead, our app is housed in the following directory structure

{% highlight bash %}
home
└── ec2-user
    └── project-root
        ├── Dockerfile
        └── public-html
            └── pokemon.html
{% endhighlight %}

`pokemon.html` contains our homepage's HTML

{% highlight html %}
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>#</th>
    <th>Pokémon</th>
    <th>HP</th>
    <th>Attack</th>
    <th>Defence</th>
    <th>Speed</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>001</td>
    <td>Bulbasaur</td>
    <td>45</td>
    <td>49</td>
    <td>49</td>
    <td>45</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>002</td>
    <td>Ivysaur</td>
    <td>60</td>
    <td>62</td>
    <td>63</td>
    <td>60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>006</td>
    <td>Charizard</td>
    <td>78</td>
    <td>84</td>
    <td>78</td>
    <td>100</td>
  </tr>
</table>
{% endhighlight %}

**Step 5**

At this point, it is worth saying a couple of things about Docker *images* and *containers*. 

A Docker image is to a Docker container what a class is to an object in OOP, i.e. one can think of the latter as an instance of the former.

So far, all we have done is start the Docker service. We have no images nor containers, thus

{% highlight bash %}
sudo docker image ls
{% endhighlight %}

and

{% highlight bash %}
sudo docker container ls
{% endhighlight %}

return nothing.

In OOP, we know that before we can create an object, we need to define a class. Similarly, before creating any containers, we need an image. Images are created via the Docker command `build`.

Go into the project root

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/project-root  # adjust accordingly
{% endhighlight %}

By default, `build` looks for a file called `Dockerfile` in the path specified. It also takes a bunch of options

{% highlight bash %}
sudo docker build --help
{% endhighlight %}

In particular, we are interested in

{% highlight bash %}
-t, --tag list Name and optionally a tag in the 'name:tag' format (default [])
{% endhighlight %}

A Dockerfile is just a text file, in our case with the lines

```
FROM httpd:2.4
COPY ./public-html/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
```

As our Dockerfile is in the project root,

{% highlight bash %}
sudo docker build --tag=myfirstdockerimage:v0 .
{% endhighlight %}

should output something like 

```
Sending build context to Docker daemon 3.584 kB
Step 1/2 : FROM httpd:2.4

Step 2/2 : COPY ./public-html/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
 ---> c0b0772949bc
Removing intermediate container 08e120a74476
Successfully built c0b0772949bc
```

on the command line which means we just created our first Docker image! 

The first line of our Dockerfile downloaded the image of a bare-bones Linux environment with Apache 2.4 installed from the offical Apache Docker repository, the second augmented this image by copying the contents of `public-html` into `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/` in the newly-created Linux environment.

Now, 

{% highlight bash %}
sudo docker image ls
{% endhighlight %}

should output something like

```
REPOSITORY           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
myfirstdockerimage   v0                  c0b0772949bc        53 seconds ago      177 MB
httpd                2.4                 b669148bb5a5        32 hours ago        177 MB
```

which shows Docker incrementally builds images following the Dockerfile line-by-line.

**Step 6**

Now that we have an image, containers can be created from it. This is done via the Docker command `run`

{% highlight bash %}
sudo docker run --detach --name=pokemon --restart=always --publish=80:80 myfirstdockerimage:v0
{% endhighlight %}

Here we use the options `name` to specify the name of the container, `restart` to automatically restart the container if it crashes, `publish` to map the relevant port inside the container (here 80) to the desired port on the server (set by convention to 80). We supply the name and the tag of the image we wish to run (if we omit the tag, it defaults to `myfirstdockerimage:latest` which errors as this image does not exist).

This should output something like

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND              CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
966ffc2fc69f        myfirstdockerimage:v0   "httpd-foreground"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   pokemon
```

and navigating to

```
http://myipaddress/pokemon.html
```

in a browser should return our app's homepage

<div><img src=
"/assets/images/posts/2017-09-09-docker-a-simple-use-case/Screen Shot 2017-09-09 at 18.18.19.png"></div>

and 

{% highlight bash %}
sudo docker container ls
{% endhighlight %}

should return something like

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND              CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
966ffc2fc69f        myfirstdockerimage:v0   "httpd-foreground"   2 hours ago         Up 2 hours          0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   pokemon
```

Finally, as mentioned above, the container runs as a process on your server. To stop it,

{% highlight bash %}
sudo docker container stop pokemon
{% endhighlight %}
