Suppose you have an Ubuntu instance (Google Compute Engine, Amazon EC2, etc.) running a web app via Nginx inside a Docker container and you would like the app to communicate over HTTPS.

There are numerous posts online on how to do this, usually using Nginx as a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) and [Docker Compose.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) This is a powerful and general solution, but if you want a stopgap, read on.

## Step 1

As Nginx is currently running inside a Docker container, it probably isn't installed yet on the host instance itself

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

## Step 2

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a free SSL/TLS certificate provider accepted by modern browsers for HTTPS communication. Certficates expire after three months and are renewable.

Installation and configuration is easiest via [`certbot`](https://certbot.eff.org/#ubuntuxenial-nginx) (follow the instructions under **`Install`**).

## Step 3

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d <mydomain>
```

replacing `<mydomain>` with the domain your app is currently being served from:

> Running this command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your Nginx configuration automatically to serve it. 

When prompted, select `"redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS"`.

At this stage, you can check everything works by starting Nginx (and stopping any processes running on ports `80` and `443`)

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

then navigating in a browser to `<mydomain>`. You should see a padlock in the address bar and the default [Debian-Nginx message.](https://www.howtoforge.com/images/install_and_configure_lemp_in_debian_9/6.PNG)

After checking,

```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

For reference, these are the nginx configuration files produced by Certbot:

`/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`

```nginx
##
# You should look at the following URL's in order to grasp a solid understanding
# of Nginx configuration files in order to fully unleash the power of Nginx.
# https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/
# https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/
# https://wiki.debian.org/Nginx/DirectoryStructure
#
# In most cases, administrators will remove this file from sites-enabled/ and
# leave it as reference inside of sites-available where it will continue to be
# updated by the nginx packaging team.
#
# This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other
# applications, such as Drupal or Wordpress. These applications will be made
# available underneath a path with that package name, such as /drupal8.

`/etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf`

```nginx
# This file contains important security parameters. If you modify this file
# manually, Certbot will be unable to automatically provide future security
# updates. Instead, Certbot will print and log an error message with a path to
# the up-to-date file that you will need to refer to when manually updating
# this file.

ssl_session_cache shared:le_nginx_SSL:1m;
ssl_session_timeout 1440m;

ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

ssl_ciphers "xxxxxx";
```

`/etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem`

```nginx
-----BEGIN DH PARAMETERS-----
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
-----END DH PARAMETERS-----
```

## Step 4

Assuming your app's `Dockerfile` contains a line similar to 

```docker
COPY ./path/to/my/html /usr/share/nginx/html
```

then in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` on the host instance, replace

```nginx
root /var/www/html;
``` 

with 

```nginx
root /usr/share/nginx/html;
```

and set the server name

```nginx
server_name <mydomain>;
```

## <a name="step-5"></a>Step 5

Add the below lines to the app's `Dockerfile`

```docker
RUN addgroup -g 1000 -S www-data \
&& adduser -u 1000 -D -S -G www-data www-data
```

and rebuild the Docker image.

## Step 6

Run the new Docker image, with some extra options:

```bash
--publish=443:443
```

to open up port `443`;

```bash
--volume=/etc/letsencrypt/:/etc/letsencrypt/
```

to get the certificates (and other required Let's Encrypt files) on the host 
instance onto the container;

```bash
--volume=/etc/nginx/:/etc/nginx/
```

to ensure the container has the same Nginx configurations as the host instance.

The last option is why in [**`Step 5`**](#step-5) the [`www-data` user needs creating.](http://blog.tobiasforkel.de/en/2016/09/10/nginx-docker-container-and-getpwnamwww-data-problem/)

## Step 7

Navigate in the browser to `<mydomain>`. You should see your app running over 
HTTPS.
