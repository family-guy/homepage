The aim of this post is to give an overview of the process rather than a full blow by blow 
account.

As such, there may be some gaps; feel free to ask for clarifications
in the comments section at the bottom!

The post assumes some familiarity with Python, Git, GitHub, and the command line on Linux / macOS, as well
as some knowledge of CircleCI (or similar).

It will try to not assume any knowledge of PyPI.

## What is PyPI?

PyPI is an abbreviation for Python Package Index. PyPI is an online repository for Python code.

All the code on PyPI is publicly available.

A file containing Python code is known as a module; a directory containing modules 
(with one module called `__init__.py`) is known as a package. Typically, such a directory only contains modules.

Thus PyPI is just a place where lots of packages live.

Packages can also be referred to as libraries, tools, apps, plugins, third-party this and that, ...

If you have done any real world programming with Python, you most likely have used a PyPI package in your code.

For example, the PyPI package `requests`, which you might have installed like this

```bash
pip install requests
```

and used in code like this

```python
import requests


r = requests.get('http://bbc.co.uk')
```

Here are some other [popular PyPI packages.](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/)

Usually, the PyPI package you are using was written by someone else.

However, if you have written a package that you would like to make 
public and part of the Python ecosystem, uploading it to PyPI is the standard solution
and you have come to the right place ðŸ˜‰.

## Definitions

A package is a directory of modules, one of which is `__init__.py`.

We define such packages as *Python packages*.

To make a Python package available on PyPI, a file `setup.py` is required which, 
amongst other things, contains metadata about a Python package.

`setup.py` lives in the same directory as a Python package.

Thus for a Python package `<python-package>`, we have the following directory structure

```
â””â”€â”€ some-dir
    â”œâ”€â”€ <python-package>
    â””â”€â”€ setup.py
```

`some-dir` often contains other files, in addition to `setup.py`, related to `<python-package>`
, e.g. documentation,
licences, configuration, tests, scripts, ...

We define directories like `some-dir` as *PyPI packages*, i.e.

`PyPI package = Python package + setup.py + other files`

So for a PyPI package `<pypi-package>`, we have 

```
â””â”€â”€ <pypi-package>
    â”œâ”€â”€ <python-package>
    â””â”€â”€ setup.py
```

One of the key metadata in `setup.py` is the __name__ that `<pypi-package>` is referred to in PyPI, 
which we will note as `<pypi-distribution>`.

## Naming (skip if in a hurry)

### Python packages

In theory, `<python-package>` follows the same rules as for [naming 
variables in Python](https://realpython.com/python-variables/)

> ...variable names in Python can be any length and can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and the underscore character (_). An additional restriction is that, although a variable name can contain digits, the first character of a variable name cannot be a digit.

However, [according to PEP](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33712857/are-there-rules-for-naming-single-module-python-packages)

> Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. __Python packages should also
have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.__

In reality, underscores in Python packages is completely fine and conventional.

### PyPI packages

As `<pypi-package>` is a directory, it can be any legal directory name as per the operating system.

However, this directory is also a repository in GitHub so it must be a legal GitHub repository name,
which means, amongst other things, there cannot be a repository with the same name for the user in question.

### PyPI distributions

`<pypi-distribution>` must follow the [rules specified by PyPA (Python Packaging Authority)](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)

> ...name is the distribution name of your package. This can be any name as long as (sic) only contains letters, numbers, _ , and -. It also must not already be taken on pypi.org.

To see if a name is taken on `pypi.org`, [search projects on PyPI.](https://pypi.org)

The convention is [to use hyphens rather than underscores](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52827722/folder-naming-convention-for-python-projects),
e.g. `flask-cors` rather than `flask_cors`.

### (Opinionated) conclusion

- Choose `<my-name>` using only lowercase letters and numbers; if too unreadable, 
separate words using hyphens, e.g. `my-very-long-pkg-name` rather than `myverylongpkgname`; `<my-name>` __must be available in PyPI and GitHub.__
- Set `<pypi-distribution>` and `<pypi-package>` equal to `<my-name>`
- If `<my-name>` has hyphens, set `<python-package>` equal to `<my-name>` with the hyphens 
replaced with underscores; otherwise set `<python-package>` equal to `<my-name>`

### Effect on end user

```bash
pip install <pypi-distribution>
```

```python
import <python-package>
```

`<pypi-distribution>` and `<python-package>` are not always the same, e.g. 

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

```python
import bs4
```

## Steps

### Check name is available in GitHub and PyPI

I checked and chose `pyexample` (in the remaining steps, replace `pyexample` and any other values as appropriate).

### Create repository in GitHub

- On local machine, `cd` to path where you would like to create files
- `mkdir pyexample`
- In GitHub, create a repository `pyexample`
- On local machine, `git init` to make `pyexample` a Git repository
- Locally, point `pyexample` to GitHub repository
    - `git remote add origin git@github.com:grking8/pyexample.git` (convention is to call the remote
repository `origin`)
    - `git remote -vv` to check
- Add a file and push up
    - `touch README.md`
    - `git add README.md`
    - `git commit -m 'Add docs'`
    - `git push origin master`
- You should see your repository in GitHub with one file `README.md`.

### Add files to local repository

- Choose a Python version; I chose `3.6`
- `cd /path/to/pyexample`
- `mkdir -p pyexample/utils`
- `touch pyexample/__init__.py`
- `touch pyexample/utils/__init__.py`
- `touch pyexample/utils/pi.py`
- `touch setup.py`

```
pyexample/
â”œâ”€â”€ pyexample
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ utils
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ pi.py
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ setup.py
```

```python
# setup.py
from setuptools import find_packages, setup


setup(
    name='pyexample',
    version='0.0.1',
    python_requires='>=3.6,<3.7',
    packages=find_packages(),
    classifiers=[
        'Development Status :: 1 - Planning',

        'Intended Audience :: Developers',

        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',
    ],
    author='Guy King',
    author_email='grking8@gmail.com',
    license='MIT',
    url='https://github.com/grking8/pyexample.git',
)
```

```python
# pyexample/utils/pi.py
import math


def get_pi_digit(n):
    digits = list(str(math.pi))
    digits.remove('.')
    return int(digits[n-1])
```

```python
# pyexample/__init__.py
from .utils.pi import get_pi_digit


__version__ = '0.0.1'
```

### Setup PyPI account

- If not already done, [sign up for a PyPI account](https://pypi.org/account/register/)
- Under `Account Settings`, create an API token with scope `whole account` (as package not yet uploaded; 
change to `project level` scope once uploaded)
- Give the API token a name
- Make a note of the API token `<my-api-token>` (should start with `pypi-`)

### Integrate CircleCI with GitHub

- Authorise CircleCI to connect with GitHub
- In CircleCI, click `Add project`
- Add newly created GitHub repository
- Trigger a build (which will fail)
- Add environment variables in CircleCI
    - Click on a job
    - Click the settings wheel
    - Click `Environment Variables`
    - Add variable; name `PYPI_USERNAME`, value `__token__`
    - Add variable; name `PYPI_PASSWORD`, value `<my-api-token>`

### Create CircleCI workflow

- `mkdir build-scripts`
- `touch build-scripts/upload-project.sh`
- `chmod u+x build-scripts/upload-project.sh`

```bash
# build-scripts/upload-project.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

PYPI_CONFIG="${HOME}/.pypirc"
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install twine
echo $'[distutils]\nindex-servers = pypi\n[pypi]' > $PYPI_CONFIG
echo "username=$PYPI_USERNAME" >> $PYPI_CONFIG
echo "password=$PYPI_PASSWORD" >> $PYPI_CONFIG
twine upload dist/*.tar.gz
```

- `mkdir .circleci`
- `touch .circleci/config.yml`

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yml
defaults: &defaults
  docker:
    - image: continuumio/miniconda3:latest
  working_directory: ~/repo

version: 2
jobs:

  build:
    <<: *defaults
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Python
          command: conda install python=3.6
      - run:
          name: Create package distribution
          command: python setup.py sdist
      - persist_to_workspace:
          root: dist
          paths:
            - .

  pypi:
    <<: *defaults
    steps:
      - checkout
      - attach_workspace:
          at: dist
      - run:
          name: Upload package
          command: build-scripts/upload-project.sh

workflows:
  version: 2
  build-pypi:
    jobs:
      - build
      - pypi:
          requires:
            - build
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master

```

- Push up changes to GitHub
- Watch build...

### Debug CircleCI workflow

If the build fails with a message like

```
TTPError: 403 Client Error: The credential associated with user 'kinggu' isn't allowed to upload to project 'PyExample'. See https://pypi.org/help/#project-name for more information. for url: https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
```

it could be that although `<pypi-distribution>` did not show up in the search, it
is unavailable because it is too similar to an existing distribution.

In my case, `pyexample` failed because there was already a distribution called `py-example`:

- Choose another name, making sure it differs by more than a hyphen or underscore to all existing distributions
- In my case, I chose `python-pypi-example`
- Update `name` in `setup.py`
- Push change up to GitHub
- Watch build...
- If build is successful, you should see a new distribution in your PyPI account.
- Delete `<my-api-token>` and create a new one with project level scope
- Update environment variables in CircleCI
- Update names from `pyexample` to `python-pypi-example`:
     - In GitHub, rename the repository
     - Locally, remove repository `rm -rf pyexample`
     - `git clone git@github.com:grking8/python-pypi-example.git` to clone from GitHub the renamed repository
     - `grep -nrw 'pyexample'` and change where appropriate to `python-pypi-example`
- Bump version to `0.0.2` in `setup.py` and `python_pypi_example/__init__.py`
- Push up changes to GitHub
- Watch build...
- Should see distribution with updated version in PyPI account

### Test new PyPI package

- `rm -rf /path/to/python-pypi-example`
- `conda create --name my-test-env python=3.6`
- `conda activate my-test-env`
- `which pip` to check you are using `pip` in the conda virtual environment
- `pip install python-pypi-example`
- `touch mytest.py`

```python
# mytest.py
from python_pypi_example import __version__, get_pi_digit

print(__version__)
print(get_pi_digit(3))
```

- `python mytest.py`

```
0.0.2
4
```
