# Bio

### $TL;DR - \frac{1}{5} \; design, \; \frac{4}{5} \; accident, \; fell \; into \; programming$
### $and \; loving \; it!$

Growing up, I never really paid much attention to programming, or computers 
in general. However, I do remember the first time I had a laptop in my
hands (an uncle's) and playing around with a chess game.

At university, one course involved some MATLAB. For a couple of weeks, I 
got quite into it, but afterwards that was that.

After university, I got a job. At work, I saw the utility of
knowing how to program. Curious, I borrowed a C++ book from a local library,
read a few pages, and was rather bemused (I quickly returned it).

Later in the same job, I bought a VBA book (a big one). I wrote a
couple of scripts that were run daily, my first "production" code! (back 
when I didn't know what that meant)

After leaving the job and going back to university, I didn't find much need
for programming until a second semester C course. I remember sitting in
tutorials thinking

> I don't like this, everytime I run something I get an error or 
> an unexpected result.
 
As the semester went on, I started passing better instructions to the 
computer, and realised you could do some pretty cool stuff with it.
In a way, it sort of brought the maths I was studying "to life". I also
enjoyed the instant (and frequent) feedback.

That summer I wrote some linear algebra routines in C. The next, I ported
them to C++, using classes for the first time.

After university, I decided to chance my arm at software development. I 
wanted to build something with a GUI so began looking at some C++ and 
Java libraries. It looked overly-complicated for what I wanted to do so I
turned to HTML, JavaScript and making websites instead.

A few months later I got a JavaScript / PHP job. My interest in web 
development, partly because it was fun, partly because it seemed to make
commercial sense (everyone needs a website, right?) continued. 
There was also a need for it at work. I had my first major collaboration 
(a front-end developer) and together we produced an MVP for a web
dashboard.

I left this job to work on a new project with two others.
We wanted to start a quant hedge fund, so it was a case of
bye-bye PHP, hello Python.

Cue months of planning, research, backtesting,
data extraction / wrangling / visualisation, debugging, and documentation.
Plus an introduction to server admin, REST APIs, system architecture, and statistical testing,
not to mention numerous red herrings, false dawns, highs, lows,
all culminating in one very stressful day where I realised the codebase
had become incredibly unwieldy and difficult to modify.

Nonetheless, the system went live :tada: (the week after Brexit :anguished:) 
but ultimately could not validate the backtests and was abandoned.

Thus back to web development and deciding between PHP and Python (or not
as was the case in the beginning). Eventually, I opted for PHP as it
seemed more popular for jobs.

However, as things turned out, a decision had to be made. I went with my 
gut... and took a Python job!

I have not been disappointed.

Getting better acquainted with the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
has been a revelation, as have Slack, Jira, Confluence, semi-distributed teams, 
merge requests, separation of concerns, decoupling, dependency management,
versioning, and sprint planning; plus repeatable, scalable, automated,
secure, performant, portable DevOps, and no doubt others.

Who would have thought there could be so much to web development? :grinning:
